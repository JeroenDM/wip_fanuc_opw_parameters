# Kinematic parameters 6-dof robots of [fanuc](https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc) package

Parameters to solve the inverse kinematics using [opw_kinematics](https://github.com/Jmeyer1292/opw_kinematics).

These files where created using [this](https://github.com/JeroenDM/urdf_to_opw_kinematics) package, with additional manual cleaning. (Noting that cannot be automated, mainly formatting and rounding issues.) These are just the robots from the package with 6 degrees of freedom, I haven't check if they all are compatible with `opw_kinematics`.

They seem to work for the following robots, based on quickly testing in rviz using the demo.launch file:

- lrmate200ib (altough the end-effector origin is not on the flange?)
- m10ia
- m16ib20
- m430ia2p

I did not look at the others. But in any case, good automated tests should be used to make sure the parameters are correct. (By comparing with the KDL forward kinematics from MoveIt!.)

I used the following bash script to extract the robot models from the fanuc package:
```bash
extension=".urdf"
find -name "*.xacro" -not -name "*macro*" -not -name "*common*" | while read line; do
    name=$(basename $line .xacro);
    rosrun xacro xacro --inorder $line > "$name$extension"
done

mv *.urdf ./robot_models
```
